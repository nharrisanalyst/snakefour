A React-Redux implementation of the classic game of snake.

The game uses the spacebar to restart and the arrow keys to play on
 Mobile on can uses the buttons to play.

The goal of the game is to eat food(brown) and grow without hitting the edge or yourself.


The game has a responsive design and a mobile strategy enabling the ui to work seamlessly on phone tablet or desktop, also the UX changes on mobile and tablet allowing one to play the game using buttons instead of the keyboard.







This game was fully designed and engineered by Nathan Harris  @NathanIHarris.
